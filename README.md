# Rental Transactions Analytics System (ETL pipeline)

This project encompasses a Dockerized setup of MySQL databases for OLTP and OLAP, it includes a Python script for Extract - Transform - Load (ETL) pipeline processes, and finally an interactive query application that you can run in your terminal.

## Demo
![](https://github.com/vsoos/etl_project/blob/main/demo.gif)

## Setup instructions
To test it you have to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your computer.
For running the Python script you will need the following libraries installed: 'pandas', 'SQLAlchemy' and 'cryptography':

```sh
pip install pandas
pip install SQLAlchemy
pip install cryptography
```
### 1. Clone repository 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vsoos/etl_project
cd etl_project
```
### 2. Run the Database (Docker)
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Run ETL script (etl.py)

```sh
cd etl_script
python3 etl.py
```

### 4. Run the Terminal app (query_app.py)

```sh
cd terminal
python3 query_app.py
```

### 5. Try out the terminal app!
```sh

## Development process

### 1. Research
- **ETL**: ETL pipelines using PostgreSQL tutorials from freeCodeCamp on YouTube [[1]](#1).
- **Faker**: Faker for generating synthetic data based on a NeuralNine tutorial on YouTube[[2]](#2).

### 2. Database Schemas
- **OLTP**: Created using DataGrip
- **OLAP**: Developed for analytical processing / extending the OLTP design

### 3. Data Generation and Preparation
- **Data Generation**: with Faker I seeded the OLTP database with random data.
- **Data Export**: MySQL dump to create portable versions of both OLTP and OLAP (mostly to avoid issues with foreign key dependencies)

### 4. Docker
- **Docker Setup**: run OLTP and OLAP databases in SQL containers on different ports (3308:3306 / 3309:3306)

### 5. ETL Pipeline in Python with SQLAlchemy
- **ETL**: wrote Python scripts to extract data from OLTP, transform it, and load it into OLAP, guided by several tutorials and articles on ETL pipeline development [[3]](#3) [[4]](#4) [[5]](#5).

### 6. Query Tool Development
- **Query Application**: developed a terminal tool for data querying and reporting from the OLAP database and used models.oy for abstraction, and to provide readability and ease of use
- **User Interaction**: enhanced user experience by allowing dynamic input with default settings (2023 / January upon clicking e.g. Enter)

### Utilization of AI

During this project, I used GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for debugging and getting preliminary structures for the ETL scripts and Docker setup. 

**Reasons for Utilizing GPT Models:**
- **Schema Validation**: The AI's ability to assess the appropriateness of the OLAP schema based on the OLTP schema proved crucial, especially when inconsistencies could lead to significant setbacks.
- **ETL**: ChatGPT was a great help in suggesting basic structures for the ETL scripts
- **Docker Configuration**: GPT models assisted in deciding the architecture of Docker containers
- **Quick Error Analytics**: effectively reduced the debugging time for me

**Disclaimer:** Given the limited resources available, I did decide to use it. By doing so, I could navigate through a steep learning curve and effectively create the final product which I am super proud of.
